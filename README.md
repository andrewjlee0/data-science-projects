## Mixed ANOVA on Psiturk Experiment Data: 
An experiment was performed on AWS using Psiturk, Javascript, D3, HTML, and CSS to reveal the role of different learning sequences (IV) on memory recall accuracy (DV). This Jupyter Notebook uses Pandas and Seaborn to analyze the DV through visualizations and mixed ANOVAs. This analysis was initially performed in SPSS.
