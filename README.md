## Mixed ANOVA on Psiturk Experiment Data: 
An category learning experiment was performed on AWS using Psiturk, Javascript, D3, HTML, and CSS. This Jupyter Notebook uses Pandas and Seaborn to analyze the dependent variable through visualizations and mixed ANOVAs. Initially written in SPSS, I extended this analysis into python code as an exercise.
