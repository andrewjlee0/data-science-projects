## Mixed ANOVA on Psiturk Experiment: 
An experiment was performed on AWS using Psiturk, Javascript, D3, HTML, and CSS to reveal the role of blocked/interleaved category learning sequences (IV) on identification recall accuracy (DV). This Jupyter Notebook uses Pandas and Seaborn to analyze the DV by graphing it against time, grouping participants into 3 subgroups, and performing 3 mixed ANOVA tests on the subgroups.
